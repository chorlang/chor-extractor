# Project is WIP

## Overview
This projects aim to implement an algorithm for extracting choreographies in Java, based on the work of Lu√≠z Cruz-Filipe, Fabrizio Montesi, and Larisa Safina.

## Compiling and Executing
First generate the extraction.network parser using maven as described in the below section. 
Then compile SimpleTest.java in the package executable, and execute the compiled class. The current implementation will only run simple tests on a hardcoded extraction.network, although the extraction.network will be extracted (if possible).

## Generating extraction.network parser
The project uses Antlr4 to generate parsers for extraction.network grammars. Build target "antlr4" with Maven.
